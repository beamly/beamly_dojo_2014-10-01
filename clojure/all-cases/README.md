# all-cases

A skeleton Clojure project for a coding dojo at Beamly London on
01/10/2014.

## The Task

For a given string, write a function or several functions that returns
a collection containing all combinations of that string. See the
readme at the top of the repository for further information.

## Tests

There are some tests in `all-cases/test/all_cases/core_test.clj`. The
tests use the standard clojure.test namespace. Docs at
http://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.test-api.html

The simplest but very slow way to run tests is by running `lein test`
in your shell. See the docs above for much faster ways to run tests
within your REPL.
