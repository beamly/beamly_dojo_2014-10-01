# Beamly Dojo 10/01/2014

A coding dojo held at the
[Beamly London](http://about.beamly.com/contact-us/) office on
10/01/2014.

This is a bring your own language dojo, where groups are encouraged to
use any language they'd like to work on the agreed upon exercise. To
help keep the repo organised, the top level directories are for
languages/runtimes. Solutions should be checked in within their
respective directories. Each top-level directory will optionally have
a skeleton project subdirectory to help you get started.
