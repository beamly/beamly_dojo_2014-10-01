# Beamly Dojo 10/01/2014

A coding dojo held at the
[Beamly London](http://about.beamly.com/contact-us/) office on
10/01/2014.

This is a bring your own language dojo, where groups are encouraged to
use any language they'd like to work on the agreed upon exercise.

To help keep the repo organised, the top level directories are for
languages/runtimes. Solutions should be checked in within their
respective directories. Each top-level directory will optionally have
a skeleton project subdirectory to help you get started.

## Proposed tasks

### All case combinations of a string

Given a string "foo", write a function that returns a collection
containing all combinations of upper and lower case for that string.

For an input `"foo"` you should get back the following collection:

`["FOO", "FOo", "FoO", "Foo", "fOO", "fOo", "foO", "foo"]`

The returned collection should not contain any duplicates.

This a suggestion, and attendees are of course welcome to choose
another task.
